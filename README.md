# Automated BibTeX Cleaner & Double-Checker

> Try it online: https://bibtex-clean-tool.streamlit.app/

## Overview

Inspired by the cool repo [bibtex-tidy](https://github.com/FlamingTempura/bibtex-tidy), this repository automates the process of cleaning, organizing, and verifying `.bib` bibliography files. It consists of two primary components:

1. **BibTeX Cleaner & Formatter (`cleaner.py`)** - Reorders `.bib` entries based on citation order in the `.tex` file, removes duplicates, and appends unused references at the end. This is adapted from the repo [SFRL/clean_bibtex](https://github.com/SFRL/clean_bibtex)
2. **Double-Checker (`checker.py`)** - Searches IEEE Xplore for accurate BibTeX citations and updates `.bib` entries while preserving the original keys. This is necessary because sources like Google Scholar often have incorrect years, incomplete metadata, or lack authoritative information.

## Features

### Cleaner (`cleaner.py`)

- **Reorders `.bib` entries** according to citation order in the `.tex` file.
- **Adds reference comments** (`% reference 01`, `% reference 02`, etc.) to track ordering.
- **Removes duplicate citations**, ensuring a concise bibliography.
- **Preserves unused entries**, appending them at the end for later use.

### Double-Checker (`checker.py`)

- **Automatically searches IEEE Xplore** for a given BibTeX title.
- **Fetches the latest BibTeX citation**, ensuring accurate metadata.
- **Maintains original BibTeX keys**, replacing only outdated information.
- **Processes a configurable number of entries** (default: 60) with a progress bar.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to install the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) if using automated web scraping.
