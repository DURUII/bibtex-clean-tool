# Automated BibTeX Cleaner & Double-Checker

> Try it online: https://bibtex-clean-tool.streamlit.app/

Actually, After the repo is built, I find there are also many repo, like [bib-cleaner](https://bib-cleaner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [bib-world](https://bib-world.com/unused), they can also remove duplicates and unused entries. I like the use case of the [bib-cleaner](https://bib-cleaner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Overview

Inspired by the cool repos [bibtex-tidy](https://github.com/FlamingTempura/bibtex-tidy) and [arxiv-latex-cleaner](https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleaner), this repository automates the process of cleaning, organizing, and verifying `.bib` bibliography files. 

It consists of two primary components:

1. **BibTeX Cleaner & Formatter (`cleaner.py`)** - Reorders `.bib` entries based on citation order in the `.tex` file, removes duplicates, and appends unused references at the end. This is adapted from the repo [SFRL/clean_bibtex](https://github.com/SFRL/clean_bibtex).
2. **Double-Checker (`checker.py`)** - Searches IEEE Xplore for accurate BibTeX citations and updates `.bib` entries while preserving the original keys. This is necessary because sources like Google Scholar often have incorrect years, incomplete metadata, or lack authoritative information.

## Features

### Cleaner (`cleaner.py`)

- **Reorder `.bib` entries** according to citation order in the `.tex` file.
- **Add reference comments** (`% reference 01`, `% reference 02`, etc.) to track ordering.
- **Remove duplicate citations**, ensuring a concise bibliography.
- **Remove/Preserve unused entries**, appending them at the end for later use.

### Double-Checker (`checker.py`)

- **Automatically searche IEEE Xplore** for a given BibTeX title.
- **Fetch the latest BibTeX citation**, ensuring accurate metadata.
- **Maintain original BibTeX keys**, replacing only outdated information.
- **Process a configurable number of entries** (default: 60) with a progress bar.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to install the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) if using automated web scraping.

## Local Streamlit Usage

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Command-Line Usage

### Running the Cleaner

```bash
python cleaner.py [bib_file] [tex_file]
```

- `bib_file` *(optional, default: ref.bib)*: Path to your `.bib` file.
- `tex_file` *(optional, default: main.tex)*: Path to your `.tex` file.

### Running the Double-Checker

```bash
python checker.py [bib_file] --num [number_of_entries]
```

- `bib_file` *(optional, default: cleaned_ref.bib)*: Path to your `.bib` file.
- `--num` *(optional, default: 60)*: Number of entries to check and update.
- `--remove_unselected`: Remove unselected entries.

## Additional Notes

Actually, after the repo was built, I found that there are also many other repositories, like [bib-cleaner](https://bib-cleaner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [bib-world](https://bib-world.com/unused), that can also remove duplicates and unused entries. I particularly like the use case of [bib-cleaner](https://bib-cleaner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

However, our tool provides more features, such as automatic ordering of `.bib` entries according to citation sequence, IEEE Xplore verification. Hope it helps you to some extent!!! üòä
